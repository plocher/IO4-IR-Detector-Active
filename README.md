# IO4-IR-Detector-Active
## License: CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2

This project started as an AT-Tiny project loosely based on [Paisley\'s designs](http://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/PhotoDetectors.html) and 
[dustinandrews instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-an-Attiny13-based-IR-proximity-sensor-for-2/step4/Wire-it-up/).

It evolved from a discrete logic circuit into an AT-Tiny one into a quad detector based on an Arduino core for ease of programming and economy of scale - one '328 is cheaper than 4x tiny's or the original (expensive) remote control TV detectors.  The current version uses a DFRobot to avoid having to low level program the AVR chips with a \'duino bootloader.
